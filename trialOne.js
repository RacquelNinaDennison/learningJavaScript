// this is my first javascript project 
//declaring variables
// java scipt only runs in the browser and node acts as the interpter 
// there are three methods , const let and var

let a = 5; // let is content specific and sorta acts as a local variable
// printing is console.log 

console.log(a)

// const is a variable is immutable
const b = 'Racquel'
console.log(b)

// b =' Orange'
// console.log(b)

a = 'Pie'
console.log(a)
